A web browser is a software application that lets you access and navigate websites on the internet. It displays websites on your screen and helps you interact with them. 
How does a web browser work? 

    A web browser requests files from web servers using HTTP.
    The server returns the information, which the browser then displays on your device.
    This includes webpages, images, videos, and other files.
