A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web content (like websites and applications) over the internet, acting as a bridge between users and the content they access through their browsers. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

Function:
    Web servers use protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to handle requests from web browsers and deliver the requested content (HTML, images, videos, etc.). 

Components:
Web servers consist of both hardware (e.g., a powerful computer with storage and networking capabilities) and software (e.g., web server software like Apache or Nginx). 
Examples of Web Server Software:

    Apache: A widely used, open-source web server software that supports various platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

   Nginx: Another popular, open-source web server known for its speed, efficiency, and ability to handle high traffic. 

  IIS (Internet Information Services): Microsoft's web server, designed for Windows servers and often used for websites and web applications that leverage Microsoft technologies.
