<!-- LAN stands for Local Area Network, connecting devices within a small area like a home or office; MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) covers a city or large campus, connecting multiple LANs; and WAN (Wide Area Network) spans broader geographical areas, often connecting multiple MANs and LANs, like the Internet. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
LAN (Local Area Network):

    Definition: A LAN connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or school. 

Examples: Your home Wi-Fi network, a network within a company building, or a network in a library. 
Characteristics: Generally provides high speeds and low latency (fast data transfer). 
Ownership: Typically privately owned and managed. 

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):

    Definition:
    A MAN connects networks within a metropolitan area, like a city, connecting multiple LANs. 

Examples:
A city's cable TV network, or a network connecting different buildings within a university campus. 
Characteristics:
Covers a larger area than a LAN, but smaller than a WAN. MANs often use high-capacity technologies like fiber optics. 
Ownership:
Can be public or private. 

WAN (Wide Area Network):

    Definition:
    A WAN connects networks across a large geographical area, such as a country or continent, connecting multiple MANs and LANs. 

Examples:
The internet, a network connecting branches of a company across different cities or countries. 
Characteristics:
Spans wide geographic areas, but often has lower speeds and higher latency (slower data transfer) than LANs or MANs.
